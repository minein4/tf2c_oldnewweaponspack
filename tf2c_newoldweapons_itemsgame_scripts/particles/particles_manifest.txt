//----------------------// Finally! NOWP has (a few) custom particles now, so this finally gets a section!
//----------------------// As of NOWP v2.7.5, I'll put all of my particle customizations in a single file, unless something comes up.
//--- User Additions ---// Also includes the usual hooks for other particles, if you need them! Also includes a few common Live TF2 particle hooks if you... need those.
//----------------------// 
//----------------------// Quick note: Putting an exclamation mark (!) in front of the particle path makes that file precache globally! There's not really a rhyme or reason to it, but try to use it sparingly.

// Catch-all if you just wanna add your own stuff quickly! Above everything else to take priority. Make + use one of these if you want to add your own sound-scripts; all 5 are unused.
