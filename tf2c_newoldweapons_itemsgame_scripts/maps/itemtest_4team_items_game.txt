//
//	Welcome to the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//			| VERSION 3.2.1 |
// By Scout's Headset / SilentFox3 / Kiri
//					-
//			(For TF2C v2.2.0)
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Heya! Welcome to the main file (or, one of them) for the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//
// This file is the main meat of this mod - this is the bit that actually adds all the weapons to the game. 
// The rest of this mod's content you see in the .vpks and etc is mostly set dressing, but this all is important!
//
// I won't go too in-depth on how to format a new entry for a new weapon (you can look over the included tutorial for that!)
// HOWEVER, I'll have left many, MANY notations about aspects of weapon types, a specific weapon, or the process of making one of these weapons as Code Comments (like you can see below)
// If you've got the time, and are interesting in learning how these Weapons tick, and the process that went into them - I encourage reading through!
//
// Stuff is ordered in the general order I made them, if you need reference to when I made stuff.
// Walk in with an open mind, and hopefully you'll learn a lot!
//
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Personally, I think it's best for the folks of you that wish to make a weapon or weapons of their own to look through this, pick things up, and learn by doing it yourselves.
// I think earnestly each and every one of you could surely learn more from doing yourself than by asking me questions about it.
//
// Use Live TF2's and TF2C's default items_game.txt, my Attributes Listing and Items_Game Tutorial a few folders back, Google / Valve Developer Community Wiki searching, and your own intuition.
// Source is an old engine. No doubt, someone has asked the same kind of questions you've had - and had them answered. Broaden your search range - you can find help in unusual places.
//
// You can find the answer to your TF2 / TF2C questions in old posts about DOD:S or CSS. You can find engine tips from the depth of HL2 modding, or even sometimes Quake discussion. Hell, even esoteric file type might be used more commonly in other games, like Sonic Generations or PSO2.
// This was all to say, don't limit yourself to just TF2, and the answers will flow in as you search for them.
//
//
// Search, problem-solve, hypothesize on problems and test solutions for them. These are valuable life skills that you really can apply anywhere - even making new funny weapons for a TF2 Sourcemod.
// People might not always be around to help you in person, so take it into your own hands if you want something done, and something done well.

"New_Old_Weapons_Pack"
{
	"items"
	{
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// For some sense of convenience, I'll try to keep my weapons up in the 3300-4500 ID range. Higher than that, I won't touch - feel free to use those for your own stuff!
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// FUNCTIONALLY though, I should only need like, 3300-4000. 8+ Updates later, and I've only barely scratched up to using maybe 300 total. Still, from now on, I'll do my best to keep in this range. You have my word.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// I'm unsure how other Weapons Packs want to handle it, but having all of our stuff cordoned off into copy-and-pasteable chunks might help quite a bit!
//-- NEW-OLD WEAPONS PACK ITEMS AREA (3300 - 4500)-------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Also, if you're wondering why such a specific number; TF2C v2.0.0 Release had its unlockable items all the way up at about the 3000 range. I figured I'd start mine at 3300 to be safe.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That's enough for the 10 classes to get 10 official weapons in EVERY weapon slot, including PDAs! Needless to say, that's far more than even Live TF2 ever had (not counting reskins).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Granted, later they reverted to having the new items be in the low 32-50's range, so that left a huge amount of space in-between. I'm not moving my weapons closer, so if you want anything that shows up BEFORE my stuff - try there!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v1.0.0 (Update 1, 7/30/2020)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Yakibomb (Crusader's Crossbow)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 40 Weapons! (13:27 New/Old)]
//
// And so, my humble weapons mod turns a new leaf and begins a new stage on its journey! Old friends and subscribers of mine might remember a time a decade ago when I was making all sorts of strange weapons for TF2C's v2.0.0 B4! It was fun then, and my hope is that it'll be fun now!
// In this first update, you'll find many returning items, both from my old projects as well as from regular TF2, and even TF2C's scrapped ideas, but I've made sure to include plenty of brand new toys to play with, too!
// Hopefully, your backpack doesn't feel so bare anymore, haha! I only plan to add more, as I get the ideas, so keep an eye out! And, hopefully, you'll have fun using this all these new weapons to maim eachother with! Have fun!

// [Authors: Valve (Assets, "Team Fortress 2" https://store.steampowered.com/app/440) | Crowbar Collective (Sounds, "Black Mesa" https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890)]
// [Overview: A Stock Reskin with HL1 flair! Unremarkable as a starting weapon goes.]
//
// In a way, beside literally being the first weapon here, the Crowbar might well be one of my first custom weapons... ever. Its story goes all the way back to the infancy of TF2C, back when the game was little more than 2007 TF2 with a Nailgun.
// I had found an SFM Crowbar in Meet the Medic's files, and wanted to make that a weapon, so I did! I kept pushing for it to be an all-class weapon like in TFC on FP Forums, but kept getting rebuffed. However, it eventually made it onto Mercenary!!
// ...who was later taken away by Class Protective Services. Whee. But, long story short, that meant I was free to just, add it back in, as a REAL all-class item, when the time came to finally make my own bundle of stuff!
//
// Other Notes:
// Since this is the very first weapon, I'll go into detail what tends to go into ANY given custom weapon!
// If you're curious about it, take a gander, otherwise feel free to skim onto the other things further down! Have fun~
// Things marked with [!] are important to have in some form no matter what, so pay extra attention to those!
//--------------------------------------------------
		"3300" 																					// [Item ID] 			[!] A unique number ID for this specific weapon! Every wpn (& variants) can only use one ID number each, so make sure you don't re-use any numbers! Most of my stuff hangs out in the 3300's and above.
		{
			"name"						"TF_WEAPON_CROWBAR"										// [Internal Name] 		- A name for some backend stuff! Set this to anything, or leave it out entirely if you like. Rarely has any effect, but sometimes gets used by Response Rules, if you mess with those.
			"prefab"					"weapon_bat"											// [Prefab] 			- A Prefab is a set of basic, predefined info - like what base weapon it is, or what classes use it - if you're making a variant of an existing weapon. Use these to save time - or set info manually if you wish! This mod has no custom prefabs, so look for examples in regular items_game.txt!
			"item_class"				"tf_weapon_bat"											// [Item Class] 		[!] What item_class is this using as a base, for basic weapon functions! Most base weapons in TF2 have useful properties, so experiment. For many of these keyvalues, these are already defined in a prefab, if using one.
			"item_slot"					"melee"													// [Item Slot]			[!] What loadout slot is this equipped in? Probably a good idea to set this, if the prefab doesn't! Note, somewhat weird behavior can result if you try to put an item in a different slot than it usually is, I won't cover that here!
			"anim_slot"					"melee"													// [Anim. Set]			- What animation set does it use in-game? This isn't needed most of the time, but can be helpful for unique weapons that use different animations (like a Secondary using Primary animations)
			"show_in_armory"			"1"														// [Show in Loadout] 	[!] VERY important for any weapon! Essentially, does it show up in your Loadout to select? This should always be enabled on any weapon you ever make!!

			"image_inventory_size_w"	"128"													// [BP Image Size]		[!] These are only useful if you AREN'T using a prefab, this just tells TF2 how wide and tall a BP image is! It freaks out if no info's defined, fun.
			"image_inventory_size_h"	"82"

			"propername"				"0"														// [Is a Proper-Name?]	- If enabled, adds the prefix "The " (or localized variant) to an item's name! As a quick rule, say "a Crowbar" or "the Crowbar" aloud; if it seems like there's multiple in any base and the name is just what it is, leave this disabled. If it seems singular, custom-made, or like its name is a "Product Name", then enable this!
			"item_name_color"			"204 204 250 255"										// [Name Color]			- A custom color for the item's name! You can use it as a stand-in for unique item rarities, if you like. The format is RGBA, and the last number is always 255 unless you're weird!
			"item_name"					"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Name]			[!] The display name of the item! This accepts plaintext, but #TF_Localization is nice if present! You can put fake-prefix words at the start of a name to stand-in for modifiers like new rarities, or stuff like killstreak or strange indicators!
			"item_type_name"			"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Type]			- What kind of generic object is this? Be concise! Use terms like "Rifle" or "Fire Extinguisher", and only add extra descriptive adjectives if it's absolutely nessecary!
			"item_description"			"Good for bashing a chucklehead's skull in."			// [Description] 		[!] A description box! Explain extra weapon functions, include short quotes, or just leave helpful info! Use TF2C's descriptions as a style-guide - you can mimic quotes by doing 'this' or “this”, and you can include linebreaks by making a new line in your text editor! You can see some examples below.
			"item_logname"				"crowbar"												// [Console Log Name]	- What it's called when referred to in Dev. Console's killfeed. This doesn't really do much, but it's good practice to have this be the same as the actual kill-icon name.
			"item_iconname"				"crowbar"												// [Kill-Icon]			[!] A kill-icon sprite to use, from mod_textures.txt! Adding new kill-icons is a long process, so you can leave this out, and it'll use the default kill-icon for the type of weapon you're using anyway!
			"image_inventory"			"backpack/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar"					// [Backpack Icon]		[!] A Backpack icon, used for your Loadout! Important note; TF2C automatically adds "_large.vmt" to the filename and tries loading that, so ".../w_crowbar" actually looks for ".../w_crowbar_large.vmt"! Keep this in mind...
			"model_world"				"models/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [World Model]		[!] A weapon's w_model - used for holding the weapon on your playermodel. You can often use Live TF2 c_models as w_models, but TF2C adds many new features, so be mindful!!
			"model_player"				"models/weapons/v_models/v_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [C / View Model]		[!] A weapon's v_model, or c_model! TF2C viewmodels are a weapon model and viewmodel anims on the same model, and that's it. Class arms are attached on afterward, so decompile a few v_models and mess around!
			"attach_to_hands"			"2"														// [Use w/v, or c?]		[!] How should this weapon use its models? Set this to "1" for Live TF2 c_models, or "2" for TF2C w/v_models. Most TF2C weapons SHOULD be "2", for the extra versatility allowed.
			"used_by_classes"																	// [Used by Class]		[!] Who's able to equip this? For a class that can equip this, it shows up in whatever loadout slot you input earlier. For multi-class weapons, you can set a slot, like "primary" instead of "1", to have that class get it in a different slot!
			{
				"scout"					"1"
			}
			"static_attrs"																		// [Simple Stats]		- Shortened weapon stats / attribs! If you're confident in your abilities, or want to add stats quickly, all this needs is an attribute name and a value, and it'll give you a working stat!
			{
				"min_viewmodel_offset"					"5 0 -10"
				"hidden separator"						"1"										// This is a special stat, that hides any other stat that appears below it. Nifty for visual clarity!
			}
			"attributes"																		// [Weapon Stats]		- Weapon stats / attributes! A weapon stat is made up of 3 main parts - its "name", its "function", and a "value".
			{
				"noise damage"																	// A stat "name" defines what text shows up to describe what a stat does, as well as how to handle numbers given by "value" - is it toggled, or flat add / subtracted ("additive")?, or multiplied / divided - ("percentage")?
				{
					"attribute_class"	"DISPLAY_ONLY"											// A stat "function" is what a stat actually does, influenced slightly by how numbers are handled by "name"! An empty or invalid function field, like here, means it does nothing - useful for text you just want to show and never do anything else.
					"value"				"25"													// A stat "value", lastly, is a modifier for whatever your stat actually does. Depending on if this is read as "additive" or "percentage" by the name field from earlier, you may need to change this!
				}
			}
			"visuals"																			// [Weapon Fx]			- Unique sounds, particles, or animations used for a weapon! Sounds here search for "soundscripts", which aren't direct sound-files.
			{
				"sound_melee_miss"		"Weapon_Crowbar.Miss"
				"sound_melee_hit"		"Weapon_Crowbar.HitFlesh"

			"mouse_pressed_sound"		"#ui/item_metal_weapon_pickup.wav"						// [Equip / Drop Snd]	[!] Select / drop sounds for Loadout items! These ARE raw sound-files, so put a full path as well as any modifier symbols as if it was a soundscript!

// You know it, you love it - the Frying Pan returns! To be entirely honest with you, this weapon did take a while to appear. Part of the way through the planning phases of the first update, I just, wanted to hit someone with a Frying Pan.
// Of course, given the only weapons back then were the Crowbar, AA Gun, and maybe FAN or Shortstop, I had plenty of room to bring back the Accursed Weapon! And it's certainly nice to have, even if it doesn't really do anything, ha...

// (ID 3320~3329) |	Conscientious Objector		|	Tags: (v1.7.5), (Old), (AllClass), (Melee), (Utility), (Weapon)							|	Extra: (Scout), (Soldier), (Pyro), (Demoman), (Heavy), (Engineer), (Medic), (Sniper), (Spy), (Civilian)
//-----
// [Authors: Valve (Assets, "Team Fortress 2" https://store.steampowered.com/app/440)]
// [Overview: A Stock Reskin, but with very slightly extra poking range.]
//
// A strange weapon to bring back, but it came from a place of (trying) to implement having your own spray as a decal on the weapon! Failing that, of course, I ended up making an entire "custom decal" system just for it...
// That aside though, it's certainly a strange weapon. Later on, I gave it very slightly longer range, as a sort of option for classes that don't natively have a longer-range weapon! Not... super, interesting, but it's fine. Maybe...
// This was largely for everyone except for Spy, who had... unique, problems. Accordingly, the range is a lot smaller for his Objector, and he later got a surprise inclusion...!
//
// Other Notes:
// Original Weapon ID was (3390 ~ 3399). Moved to AllClass Reskins section.
// If you want to use custom decals, extract "custom_objector_decals_go_here!" from the Mod Install into your custom folder, and edit the "decal_team.vtf" files within! More details in a text file there.

// The first actual weapon! Let's get crackin'! I decided I wanted to bring the Shortstop back, first, since Scout has really been missing... much of anything to use. And, since I've already made this once before in my old videos, this is a natural next-step!
// Though... not without some growing pains along the way, unfortunately. Given how... uniquely, scuffed this weapon is, it swapped back and forth between being based on a Pistol, then a Revolver, then Nailgun, and finally just, no bullshit, just a Scattergun.
// And, as far as how it works, it's just a very no-shenanigans version of Live's Shortstop (the old one), just a good mid-range option in your usually close-range toolkit. Importantly, with the old reload speed, and even some of the new perks! No shove, though. You've got another gun for that!

// [Overview: Scout - A Shotgun that provides increased mobility and disrupts enemy movement!]
//
// A two-parter for my old, returning weapons, is Scout's iconic double-barrel scattergun with more recoil than he or the enemy can handle, the Force-a-Nature! I've always really, really liked the way it felt to fire this gun, so naturally I wanted to bring it back ASAP, too!
// At first, though, all it had to its name was the damage-dealing parts. No knockback, whatsoever. It made it a bit disappointing to shoot and not get any mobility or enemy-bothering ability out of it, but luckily, both of these got added back with future TF2C updates, so it finally works as intended!
// With surprisingly little fuss, too - the original really already is a heavily-mangled scattergun. So, for better or worse, your favorite neighborhood double-barrel is back in town to send dumbasses off cliffs and you to the safe clutches of the nearest medkit! As it was meant to be.

// [Overview: Soldier - A RL focused on comboing rapidly using afterburn! See: Live CM5K, Dragon's Fury, Double Scotch]

// I have this strange fascination with the CM5K, ever since it was first added to Live - it doesn't really have much going for it in any iteration, but it just... feels nice, to shoot and handle. Against my better judgement, then, here it is in TF2C!
// For a while, this used to essentially be a stock reskin with one more rocket and afterburn. Since then, I'll be honest I've struggled trying to figure out a unique way to implement this weapon, ha... I've tried a laundry list of different RL, Huntsman, and even Coilgun-base experiments!
// For NOW, I settled on this - a sort of combo-launcher that turns the afterburn into a meaningful mechanic! Is it good? Probably not. Will it work for now!? Who knows!

// I wanted to tackle it being a variant of the Umbrella, for Soldier; it makes a single ally at a time faster! And, as of writing, yourself too! Sadly, can't really modify the cooldowns, but it is what it is.
// While I'm fairly happy with this interpretation, if they ever add proper addcond on ally hit stuff, then I'll most likely split this! And, Civ may have a new toy on the horizon... only if.

// 900 pounds of percision-mounted steel and highly compact wiring is no match for your ultimate weapon... an ordinary sledgehammer! Imagine what you could do if someone was dumb enough to leave behind a 20 pound little electric sink... oh, wait!
// All said, though, your favorite sledgehammer works about the same as it always has... does more damage to buildings, and less to your squishy, fleshy enemies. Though, because of how TF2C doesn't have that many stats to its name, this acts more like a weird Wrench than it does a fireaxe. Just keep it in mind if you want your own sapper-deleter!

//
// Surprise! Our Eternal Reward is back in TF2C, and it's just as surreal and strange as ever! Obviously, it doesn't work 1-1 to how it does in Live, but failing that I wanted to try a slant on what it literally does - transform you on the spot.
// As it would turn out, TF2C was experimenting with such a thing... for some reason!! So, a new weapon was born! It has growing pains, yeah, a lot of them actually, but it fulfills a funny and interesting niche.
// You still "transform" on the spot, but instead of just a disguise... you literally switch classes and copy weapons instantly. Truly, the master's gambit to Spy is to be prepared to play another class the moment your knife pokes somebody!

// [Overview: Scout - A Throwable that does more damage from further away! Also causes bleed. See: Brick]
//
// Next on the chopping block is the Flying Guillotine! I wanted to take a crack at returning another throwable weapon from Live, but not many of the others seemed suitable, so I figured I'd try the Guillotine! After all, it's just damage!
// And, for a while, it was just that, damage with a bleeding effect. Simple, but the Live one didn't have so much goin' on, either. Eventually, I managed to get the long-range damage working as well, to create an odd facsimile of it! Close enough!
// Heck, and then they added the Brick, which is a very no-nonsense version of the Cleaver. Well, it can't be helped. I suppose what it does right now is sufficient to stand out a bit, even if only so. I'd remove the knockback if I could! But, well... let's say, the brick's blood runs deep, here.

// [Overview: Spy - A Melee for pestering or throwing the enemy team off balance. Also assists your gun-usage!]
//
// It's a knife! It's a gun! It's a knife-gun! Or maybe just a gun, it's the Inside Jab! For no particular reason I just wanted this weapon usable in a mod of mine, so it was a reskin for a very, very long time. Well, no more! Probably!
// This went through several iterations, including a lot of tests trying to make it use the unused Throwing Knife as a base, but I eventually decided maybe simple IS better. It's essentially a shove, so use it to push enemies into harm's way or get them off your back.
// Of course, you could also just use a Knife to instantly kill somebody, but where's the fun in that!? Why knife somebody to death, when you could shoot them to death... with a knife! Gun! Thing.

// a lot of basic amenities didn't exist... least of which, was a Flare Gun or even flare projectile. So, back then, in order to make a Flaregun, it shot rockets! With accompanying HUGE knockback! It was fun to jump around tr_walkway with it, even if it was a little bit jarring.

// Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol! Say that four times fast. I've been wanting to give Scout a new Pistol unlock for some time, so I figured I'd take a crack at it with this! Kinda!
// As it is right now, it's a remake of the current Live TF2 one, which turns it into a supportive health-steal gun! I have tried older variations of it, but perhaps simpler is better. The very old PBPP of Valve's is a little conflicted.
// Additionally, of all of Scout's pistols, I figure Engineer gets the most out of this without outright breaking things, so I decided to later give it to him, too. Under a different name, sadly. But, the point still stands!

// [Comm. Contributors: Kristofer (B4 Cyclops)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (3:2 New/Old). Adds Kill-Icons]
//
// A new TF2C update calls for a new weapons pack update to match! Truthfully, though, this update sorta came out of nowhere a bit sooner than I expected, so sadly I don't have too much weapons-wise for ya. The ideas I do have are pretty experimental, though!
// But, hey, that's not all, at least! I wanted to take these weapons' authenticity up a level, so what better way than to FINALLY add killicons! Yep, that's right, new icons for everything I've made thus far! It took a bit of doing, but I think I figured out a pretty good way to make 'em in the style of TF2C!
// Paired with these backpack icons I've been doing, and more of my new material and model changes, I hope these push a little closer to being "TF2C quality", silly as my weapons may be! I was already goin' for that, but hopefully it feels even MORE authentic!! Okay, have fun, and kill lots and lots for me~!

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench that excels at upgrading things FAST, but has abysmal metal recovery. Also hits harder.]

// Another case of "bit-off-more-than-I-could-chew", it's the Eureka Effect! Originally, this was a wrench that "teleported" metal over to your buildings when hitting other people with it. It worked just about as well as that sounds it did.
// Unlike the S. Hospitality, though, this was in a... let's say, scuffed spot to recreate in TF2C. There's nothing else I can really even do that has any vague relation to "teleporting", so I had to hit the drawing board. I almost scrapped it.
// EVENTUALLY, I came up with a brief stopgap - recreating the wrench's ability to quickly get things built up near Spawn and then switching to another wrench! Scuffed, but it'll do until I can invent an AOE Repair-Pulse wrench or Radius Wrench or something...!

// You know what they say, sometimes you have to fight fire (enemy gunfire) with fire (scalding hot pressurized water)! Who said water always had to be your worst enemy - now it can be theirs!
// Jokes aside, this is a returning weapon of mine, back from VERY old versions of the Weapons Pack, and I wanted to do good by it when it came time for it to finally return. Initially, this was an afterburn-setter... but that didn't feel so great.
// Then, it was a flamethrower that provided buffs. Better, but the buffs were way too strong and easy to maintain. Finally, it became a healthrower, which is... servicable? I like how it plays, though the visuals are a bit awkward, ahah... but you just have to do what you can.

// The Pistol was always a peculiar weapon, even the Stock variant! Since, between Scout and Engineer, Scout has a measly 36 reserve, while Engineer gets a mind-boggling 200 reserve ammo to work with! While Scout has to be careful about ammo management for pestering, Engineer gets more than he ever needs!
// No more! I wanted to make a pistol entirely designed around giving Scout some more disposable ammo to play with, for harassing people and chipping at buildings or targets. It fires slower, and does a less damage, too, so it won't usually win you fights, but for disposable ammo, it's unrivalled. Finally, a use for your duffel bag!
// Though, people have always kept asking me about adding this to Engineer, too. Unlike many other pistols, no, this is very explicitly designed for Scout. And, really, let Scout have this - Engineer doesn't need even MORE disposable ammo for free!

// [Overview: Demoman - A SBL that's focused on high speed and lower-damage! A veeery loose reflection of the Live one...]
//
// It's a Quickiebomb Launcher! Not 'the', sadly. 'A'. Since so many properties are missing in TF2C, I decided to see if I couldn't lean full tilt into the name and general vibe of the SBL - a much faster performing option compared to Stock!
// In Live, this is accomplished with the faster arm time, and the niche is more focused on fully charged stickies. Here, though, for the time being it's just pure speed. Lay down a trap, 'quick', even if it's much less potent! Sometimes, speed is king.
// This had an older variant, where it fired a single sticky at a time and couldn't manually detonate - but I might instead turn that into its own weapon later...

// At first, it was all static - you got a fair boost to damage and speed but at the cost of pretty dangerous health drain or vulns! That was eh. They later added an attribute to raise firerate with health, and I knew that was the ticket.
// It only resembles the Equalizer on the surface, currently, but it somewhat has the same general effect, where lower health means you do more damage! Except, instead of being a literal damage increase, it's output increase! Close enough. Back to chippin' away you go!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.1.5 (Update 5, 5/21/2021)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 19 Weapons! (12:7 New/Old). Adds Response Rules. Adds LoDs globally]
//
// Finally, a new TF2C update appears! And, with it, a new weapons pack update! Lucky you~ As always, though, there's a lotta sleek new toys for y'all to mess around with, and this time, some even come with custom voice responses, just like the regular weapons in TF2C! I was debating for a long time whether or not to edit these, but decided it was worth it for the ~immersion~!
// I also took the time to do a lot - and I mean, a LOT of rebalances for most of the weapons! I'm sure you can tell by now that balance... isn't, exactly one of my strong-suits, but I'm still gonna try, at least. I'm thankful all of you took the time to give me advice about things to change, and want to make the weapons as fun to play with as they are to make!
// I have big, big plans for the next update, and hope to see y'all when TF2C v2.1.0 finally appears! I've had a lot of exciting things I want to show y'all soon, but until then! Well, what are ya waitin' for!? Kick some ass, and shoot some lead!

// Initially, I was planning several variants, including one that had a hammer-racking animation like a Sniper Rifle, and one built on the PaintballRifle, but I settled simpler was better, and just settled for one using the newly-made and very similar Hunting Revolver!
// From the get-go, it's a much faster, weaker sidegrade of that, but where the Hunting Revolver has a focus on frankly nightmarish stopping power, this offers sheer speed!

// [Overview: Engineer - A Nailgun that fires incredibly fast but has higher spread and uses metal. Also helps Sentry upkeep! Also has the usual mid-long range properties of a Nailgun.]
//
// To be entirely honest, I had the idea of making a Nailgun for Engi, and sorta just rolled from here, ha... it's, servicable. I do struggle a lot trying to figure out what to do with this, but eventually settled on... this!
// Compared to Engi's other weapons, it's got vicious burst-damage potential, as well as being, well, a Nailgun - good for building and destroying (people). A solid weapon for mid-range combat - but resource intensive and inaccurate!
// That's it, I suppose, haha... I'd love to make more Nailguns, had I the inspiration, and importantly... more models for it. Ah well, c'est life!

// For those times an enemy is (annoyingly) hovering just outside of your range and you really need some way to get them to approach or flee... up the ante a little, with a shotgun that has less spread! This is a simple, but effective, little tool for your arsenel.
// Initially, this began as a Heavy shotgun, and I was flirting with the idea of just having it unconditionally do more damage, but that's... not terribly interesting. So, how about giving it more bullets and making those somewhat more accurate! I suppose Pyro can have it, too, they've been a good [censored]~

// An old classic I'm sure you might remember, the Lever Rifle returns from the grave! Sadly, it had to leave behind its old, snazzy animations, but in its wake, it gets new snazzy animations! Fling your shotgun around with reckless abandon for others and yourself!
// As far as what it actually did, though, I never particularly knew what to do with it until relatively recently. It began as a reskin, later turning into an odd "less pellets higher damage" deal, and finally, to this iteration! You start with low-ish ammo, but incrementally get more and more with more kills!
// By default, it starts quite a bit weaker than the default Scattergun, but increases to a comical amount of ammo after just a few kills! Your low damage and slower reload is an ever-present facet of this weapon, though, so pick the right times to run in and unload one, two, three, four, and five shots into your unsuspecting enemies!

// Whack, thwack, smack! Cut loose and cut, hack, and slash your foes to pieces with the beloved kukri, the Bushwacka! This was a relatively early concept, but even when it started working, there was the problem of... figuring out how to balance it around NOWP's Sniper.
// See, he plays the same, but he has a LOT more tools at his disposal that apply MfD - and thus make this thing do full crits! It's a bit scary, and for the time being all I have (in addition to the old downsides) is a slower swing speed.

// [Comm. Contributors: Basil PFP / OCsonic, azzy (Thermal Thruster)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 32 Weapons! (14:18 New/Old). Adds texture mipmaps globally. Updates Kill-Icons to use hooks]
//
// Well, this has been a long time coming, but after so, so long, the Big Update is here! For NOWP, that is. While TF2C v2.1.0 takes its sweet time to appear, I think it really is due time I show y'all what I've been working on for this long...!!
// This is, by far, the biggest update I've ever made for any of my mods, by a LONG shot! Dozens of new weapons, too many balance changes, new responses, cleanup and polish all-around, and even more, all with the goal of making New-Old Weapons Pack the best it can possibly be! So, I really, really do hope that reflects in this update of a lifetime!
// That said... this update cycle sure has been something. Having worked on this for the better part of the year, I think this should be a good spot to leave the mod in for a bit. I hope you all enjoy, and blast eachother to smithereens! Just like I (and K.R. Fawkes) would have intended. Ehehe...

// A classic returns, familiar to those of you who've played Opposing Force before - the M249 SAW! In typical TF2 fashion, I wanted to exaggerate its qualities - amping up the recoil pushback to 11!
// While the LMG is very strong in its debut game (and most other games for the matter), I wanted to make it a full mobility tool first and foremost. Of course, it's perfectly decent at killing, but use it to course-correct or reach even further with a jump!
// With its very, very low ammo and high spread, though, you'll find yourself hurting for ammo for it quite often! Try giving your ol' Shotgun a whirl, it might still save your life. Otherwise... this is one of my favorite and cleanest weapons I've made. No changes needed!

// A weapon from TF2C's early-mid development returns, it's the Makeshift Mutilator, a chemical-flamethrower! Initially, this was essentially just lifted out of that version, but I wanted to do a different spin on it since a flamethrower that... just, does more damage, is a bit dull.
// Over time, I settled on trying to make it a flamethrower that does more damage, but only situationally. As it is currently, it has a single-target focus and excels at building-busting and VIP-hunting, but suffers when it comes to really causing groups to panic. Or, I hope so.
// Sigh... there's a lot more to do here, but it is what it is! I was briefly spitballing an acid-ball flamethrower... which honestly might be good enough to make its own weapon... hmm~

// [Overview: Medic - A Shotgun that shoots syringes en-masse, for combat or dissuading approaching enemies! See: Shotgun, Crusader's Crossbow]
//
// THAT'S RIGHT - RED ALERT!! MEDIC HAS A SHOTGUN! But, don't panic, this version is the closest I could do to get it working in a half-believable way for Medic... it STILL fires syringes! This sounds like a minor detail, but it's very important it stays.
// If allowed to be hitscan, well someone would just use that over a projectile weapon, any projectile weapon, if they have the choice, since you do damage instantly as soon as you press the button. So, having projectiles still allows this to... sorta... fit Medic's existing playstyle!
// Well, does it fit well? Probably not! But, I wanted to try, and I'm reasonably happy with the result. All said, though, it's a lot weaker than a regular Shotgun even so, so keep those Syringe Guns handy!

//
// Jam out to some catchy tunes, and kill dopes all the while; the CSMG clears some room for itself in the back-pocket of your favorite (or least favorite) boston bruiser! Since a certain masked delinquent isn't using it, may as well give it to the next best (or worst) person!
// For no particular reason, I just really liked the CSMG, so decided to bring it back for a sort of "OF Weapons Mini-Pack" that I'd use in my TDM_ map conversions! That... didn't really pan out. But, I salvaged this (and the Brimstone!), and gave them a sort of new lease on life.
// Now, it's a particularly powerful secondary SMG for Scout! Its sheer strength and speed is cut, however, by its absolutely abysmal accuracy and ammo capacity. Run up close, and aim well, you can dish out the hurt quickly, but once you're out of ammo, so can they. Fill 'em with miami lead, quick!

// The Caber... kinda, returns! This weapon has had a really messy development - initially, it was a weird hybrid weapon that did minicrits against "aiming" players (aka Snipers), hearkening back to those clips of Demomen obliterating Snipers across the battlements.
// Later on, it got more prototypes to actually make it... yknow, explode. On hit. No such luck, sadly, but I got it to explode!! Don't look behind the curtain, it's kinda a mess, haa... But, all said, this (newer) iteration has promise!
// Honestly, Caber has a half-decent chance of one day actually having its mechanics added, but for now, this gimmicky facsimile will have to suffice...

// [Overview: Engineer - A PDA that makes Dispensers and Teleporters build and act VERY fast, but with dramatically low defenses.]
//
// Hoo, this is a doozy. This PDA is, in short, a supercharged Gunslinger, or maybe a Mini-Buildings PDA as a whole. Just like how the Gunslinger deploys faster, weaker sentries, this is intended to deploy faster, weaker buildings in general.
// As one could guess due to this being, well, all of them at once, it effectively has three entire weapons' worth of internals to wrangle with!! As a result, though, it makes a hyper-offense focused Engineer toolkit. Build fast, think fast, move fast.
// This item... I'll be honest is likely to get instantly obliterated into like 2-3 sub-weapons come the removal of custom PDAs, which I'm not looking forward to, but is a reality that's getting closer!! Hoo boy!
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Dispensers and Teleporters build fast.
// Buildings have 127 HP (from 150). Buildings can't be upgraded. Dispenser + Teleporter cost 30% less metal to build (130 70 35)
// Dispenser generates surplus metal and do more healing. Teleporter builds as fast as a Jump Pad
// When combined with the split variant, Buildings have 82 HP (from 150), Build Cost is reduced, etc

// [Overview: Engineer - A SBL that shoots a Dispenser landmine, to defend a single area at a time. See: Mine Layer, Explosive Dispenser]

// One day, I was hazily taking a shower at like 2 AM, and suddenly, the words "The Dispenserizer" appeared in my head. Rapt by this, I knew immediately I had to fully realize that this even entailed. A manic night ensued, but sure enough, at the end... was the Dispenserizer.
// That aside, I had been toying previously with the idea of area landmines that acted more as deterrents or detection tools. So, in a strange twist of fate, this became a realization of that concept! A diet mine-layer for Engineer, essentially.
// Engi can deter people off of any one flank of his choice, or at least know people are coming! Powerful as it is, it replaces his Shotgun (now, anyway), and doesn't do a horrible amount of damage, so you'd still strictly be better using a Shotgun for direct combat! I hope, anyway.

// Get this guy - no, this guy! Aw, what the heck, why not dis guy too! Dash around like a madman, and make key targets on the enemy team sweat bullets (figuratively and literally) with the Fan of War! As such a simple weapon,
// Most of it remains the same, with you marking people as high-priority targets with a big skull over their head for you or your allies to take out with reckless abandon! But, with one key difference... you can mark multiple people for death at once.
// Because of this, the time for an individual mark is a lot lesser, and I thought it'd be a good idea to slow down switch-off speed too. Thusly, you'll want to mark 1-3 targets, dash away, and then swap back! After all, you're not going to be doing much damage with this alone. To victory!

// [Overview: Heavy - A Minigun that sacrifices your mobility and reaction time for sheer damage!]
//
// Don't got anywhere to go fast? Don't worry, you can make sure the enemy doesn't have anywhere to go fast, either... hold down the fort with this decidedly not-brass beast of a minigun as it shreds through hallways with devestating damage!
// Functionally, it just works as it did before... you are VERY, very slow with revving, but the damage from your minigun is potentially some of the scariest in the game! Paired with a dispenser, and / or a source of crits? The enemy may as well set up camp, they're not makin' it through alive.
// Given its properties, this is a surprisingly very defensive minigun, you'd mainly use this in places where you KNOW enemies are going to approach you; a perfect match for a defensive role! Although it's missing the extra damage resistance, too, I think it still works as such.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.3.5 (Update 7, 8/8/2022)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 14 Weapons! (8:6 New/Old)]
//
// Hey! I... wasn't expecting to be back so soon, but no rest for the wicked, I guess! In any case, I've already prepped a bunch of new weapons and a LOT, I mean a LOT of balance changes for y'all! Hopefully this... works?
// ...If I might be blunt, I think the fatigue is starting to set in, I hadn't really even gotten any real rest from last update before I needed to hurry back and push this update to fix the balancing. Which, might I remind you, I'm not stellar at!
// Well, I think THIS time, I've earned a solid break. Thus far I've made 7 entire updates for TF2C v2.0.0 and its patches... and I just want to take a breather for a while, until next update actually decides to release! Think of it as an extended summer vacation! Take a load off and spill some blood, hopefully I'll see y'all soon...!

// From the get-go, it was relatively fast-attacking and had increased damage for later hits, but wouldn't really find its footing until I made TF_WEAPON_CYCLOPS_DBL - after which I essentially turned this into a melee Cyclops, hehe.

// A very, VERY strange and experimental weapon, I wanted to toy with the idea of Spy deploying "decoys" or other distractions. At first, I wanted a Decoy Watch that deploys a model decoy, but that didn't pan out at all.

// [Overview: A Melee that passively heals you while held out, but isn't good for combat and leaves you vulnerable. Also swings faster!]
//
// Since having seen and played Yakibomb's Renaissance Revival weapons pack, I immediately loved the comedy value of their own guitar that became the namesake for this, the Bonkulele (1)! In that mod, it always crits on the first hit and does normal damage after.
// To be honest, I sorta started there, and worked backwards. As it is right now, it's a simple healstick - you get health back while it's held out, but you're at risk from enemy attack while doing so! Can imagine you'd be sitting down, relaxing, strumming a tune...
// ...before, of course, bashing someone's head clean in with it. Hey, something special happens if you hit someone that's airborne with this! That'll teach 'em.

//
// A peculiar weapon, the Liberty Launcher makes its appearance! It's quite an odd weapon at first blush, since none of the stats particularly jump out at you... or even seem to work together at all.
// After some time, though, I've figured that it acts as something of a middle-ground between the Rocket Launcher and Jumper. Better at blast jumping, worse at damage, but still able to do both competently!
// Maybe this should have jumped out at me sooner, ha, considering it's a companion piece to the MG! And it has 5 rockets. And a higher proj. speed. For some reason? For liberty.

// Eventually... I settled on this. A Shotgun that has temporary damage AND ammo bonuses, but poor ammo maintenence otherwise! It's... a start.

// It's written right into the Constitution, you have the right to bear arms. Who knew they'd be this vintage and full of gun magic! This has always been such a novel idea, but I've always been held back by any combination of animations and lack of direction...
// It shot people out of the sky, 'till it didn't. Then it shot explosive musket bullets! 'Till it didn't. And currently, the least gimmicky of them, it just does more damage close up! Aim for the whites of their eyes! Or... try to.
// To be entirely honest, I really want a better idea for this weapon, but I sincerely don't know where to start, ahaa...

//
// A new challenger arrives on the Pyro Projectile-Launcher scene... it's the (former) Molotov Launcher! This weapon has had a... messy... history, but I think I'm finally happy with where it is currently, so we'll see if that stays.
// My initial ideas were to have it shoot Molotovs that provide a lingering AoE effect, but that... didn't really pan out. I don't think any of us really liked the 4-shot explosive molotovs, either, and it was just so bulky and... y'know what? Back to the drawing board!
// I figured for a rework of this, I wanted to focus more on it being a more general-purpose, faster, easier to use slant on the DF! Fast, low damage, decent splash, and otherwise no special effects. Simple, but feels and looks a lot better than before. We'll see if it needs more spice, soon...!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.5.0 (Update 8, 4/29/2022)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 29 Weapons! (14:16 New/Old). Adds Secret Weapons. Updates items_game to use hooks]
//
// IT'S FINALLY HERE! To match with the monumental occassion of a NEW MAJOR UPDATE, I've assembled one of the biggest updates New-Old Weapons Pack has yet seen, with dozens of new weapons, restored function for old weapons, and so. So much polish. To make this maybe the single best version of NOWP yet!!
// I really can't understate how much of everything changed, everything I could think of to fix, simplify, and overhaul - I did so. I've been planning this update out from as soon as early 2021, even working concurrently with my earlier updates, and always having planned this to be a simple patch to add some goodies for TF2C v2.1.0!
// Well, evidently, things took a little longer than intended, and I had to roll some stuff back into NOWP v2.2.5. But, I think, this is it. The update, as I always meant it to be, is FINALLY OUT!! Paint the badlands red today, boys, you've earned it. Make us proud.

// [Overview: Demoman - A Shield with heavy focus on mobility, w/ weaker properties overall. Since ALL shields in TF2C do this, has 1-2 extra benefits!]
//
// Demoman finally gets a shield! This, initially, was intended to be the Chargin' Targe, but given how TF2C's shields work with their complete turn freedom, I didn't feel it was right to implement it as-is. So, instead of that, I added this!
// This shield existing should be a familiar baseline, although not identical to Live. It doesn't strictly have 'downsides', per-se, but here it acts somewhat as the "default" shield, in a similar role the C. Targe held originally. So, not much special going on.
// Since the charge turning is a property of ALL shields, as of writing, this has a faster recharge time to act as a more readily available mobility option that recharges somewhat fast!
//
// Other Notes:
// Stock Weapon for the purposes of other weapons. Not actually a stock weapon.

// Other Notes:
// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a fairly long time and was ALMOST confident in releasing, the Helicopter Gun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it applied very weak pushback force onto Heavy to allow him to hover in the air if he shoots directly downward. Offset by extremely low ammo, low dps, and extra fall damage (don't sleep on this it HURTS)
// However, despite my best efforts, there was too much weirdness with all sorts of things like explosives, Jump Pads, and even -water- making Heavy skyrocket into the Skybox. This wasn't something I think people would stomach dealing with...

// [Overview: Spy - A Sapper that does more damage faster, but on a strict timer! See: RTR]
//
// Making a Sapper unlock is tricky business; a lot of the properties of what makes a Sapper, "a Sapper", weren't at all controlled by items_game.txt or even the weapon script... it's mostly controlled by objects.txt, the file for buildings!
// That was, up until recently, but even so the only thing that changed was the ability to set a custom view and world model, as well as SOME stats. Still, I felt this was enough to make a simple new Sapper, failing my ideas for a RTR port.
// In principle, though, this DOES replicate part of it still: It drains health INCREDIBLY fast relative to the stock Sapper! Unlike the RTR, though, it's less sturdy, not more. And it even removes itself quickly. Use this to get an Engineer to panic and try to force an opening for attack!

//
// Your local Engineer was so kind as to not only listen to your pleas to "Put Dispenser here!", but also help you dispense out a load of punches, pain, and suffering onto your enemies! With added electricity, to boot! I initially wanted this to be a Chekhov's Punch variant,
// but unfortunately, there's not so much you can do with those stats beside making... a slightly different Chekhov's. So, I started from scratch, with the idea of making something that looked like it could store an electrical charge. And so, the whole combo-crit mechanic arose!
// This is, hopefully, a faster more active slant on both the Chekhov's and the KGB. Run in, hit foes over and over, and go on a rampage! Be wary, though, this thing's clunky, and your entire arm being Dispenserized means you might be unhappy to be on the other end of a rocket or pipe, now, comrade...

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench-thing that deploys fast-building, weaker sentries. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is the Gunslinger! It doesn't visually look like it is, but it will be later. This weapon emerged from very odd circumstances - the PDA: Rush Order was getting EXTREMELY crowded, and unfortunately, I had to split it.
// This effectively acts as one-half of it, and acts similarly to how the Live TF2 variant does - it deploys a faster-building and acting Sentry Gun! And has some other weird bonuses and negatives. It's very weird. I can't promise it'll get less weird...
// When the time comes - either be it the removal of custom PDAs or a way I can port the Gunslinger model in without looking fucked up - I'll most likely do even more things to this. Stay tuned...!?
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Sentries build fast.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50)
// Sentry behaves a-la Mini Sentry in Live TF2 (faster firerate, turn rate, but less damage, knockback)

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.7.5 (Update 10, 9/7/2023)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (8:3 New/Old). Adds custom particles]
//
// It's the moment you've all been waiting for... for both TF2C, and NOWP! It was a long wait, but hopefully worth it - I started work on this update (and even the previous one, NOWP v2.6.5!) with anticipation for TF2C v2.1.2's features, and it's finally here!
// To start, I wanted to try making a lot of new, inventive weapons, this time - weapons I don't usually make variants for! On top of that, I wanted to really push QoL to the next level in a way I haven't done in some time. How? Well, new particles for EVERYTHING, new supplemental mods like dropped mags and shells, and more fixes than I can count!!
// It's been a while, but I really am happy with how this update turned out, despite everything. My goal has always been to make these silly things with a level of quality on-par with Eminoma / TF2C Team's own efforts for TF2C, and I think I'm just about there... finally... But, enough about me. Stop gawkin', and start killin'!

// Eventually, though, I made... honestly probably one of the only bows I -could- make. Since one of the few things you can even do with Huntsman-likes is just changing fire-speed, this one has faster speeds as a lynchpin that everything else builds on!
// It's... servicable. There may be a lot going on with this particular bow, but it's because none of them can really carry the bow on their own, so together they join forces to create... a bow that's marginally more scuffed! Hooray!

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 3 Weapons! (2:1 New/Old)]
//
// Merry Australian Smisskwanzukkah! To celeberate this momentous occassion (and also a new TF2C update), I've made a handful of gifts for the road! No, shh, they're not "weapons", they're "gifts"! (What, are you trying to get me in trouble with Homeland Security??)
// Alongside the new weapons are even more QoL changes, like bloodied weapons on crit-kills, and FINALLY fixing that stupid Medigun beam bug after months of work (no thanks to a certain server), so hopefully NOWP will finally be... okay, hhh, look, I need to level with you for a moment.
// I'm so, so tired. It's thankless work, and having to play fix-up because somebody else can't be bothered to properly maintain their own work has been getting increasingly frustrating to me. I need a break, for a long time. I'll be back, don't worry, but I need some time. Take care, and have fun...!

// Making new shields for Demoman proved... difficult. Many of the Live TF2 shields, see, have the turning restriction embedded as a core downside to using them! Without that, they're simply overwhelmingly strong, especially to have multiple of them...
// So, honestly, to sidestep the issue, I wanted to try my hand at making a new shield WITH the turning changes in mind! It's... simplistic, but it may change yet whenever TF2C adds more interesting conds to add while "charging"!
// All said, though, it's a simple defensive shield. You can still charge, and doing so raises your defenses even higher momentarily. Servicable!

// En garde! A centerpiece for any honorable (or dishonorable) duelist, a classic rapier! I was somewhat inspired by several different weapons packs to make something new for ol' Spy, looking at their interpretations of "burst-fire" melees and also other Rapiers!

// Welcome back! I missed y'all, and this time I have the biggest update in, shoot, a while! All this time off meant I had a lot of time to reflect, but also a lot of time to put polish and effort into making these again! Not that I wasn't before, but I think you can tell the last few were a little bit rushed, haa...
// This time, everybody gets a new toy or gadget to play with, the QoL is as high as it's ever been, and the balancing! Well, I still suck at balancing, but I've made an effort to rebalance almost everything slightly! This update, for the first time in a long time, has a little bit of everything!
// I'm happy with it, I really am. But, I've gotten to thinking about the longevity of New-Old Weapons Pack, and I don't want it to grow forever like certain other projects. So, I think it's time I think about closure, soon...! But, not quite yet. So, while you still have little ol' me here, maim some people and make me happy!

// [Overview: Sniper - A Throwable that inflicts enemies with various weaker status effects, useful to track and finish fleeing enemies or for your teammates to use! See: Jarate, KOCW Jar o' Ants]
//
// Piece a' piss... it's a new Sniper throwable! Finally, Sniper gets the ability to throw OTHER fluids at his enemies that (hopefully) aren't from his own body this time! With luck it'll stay that way, but no promises.
// I was torn between wanting to make something more support-oriented vs. movement oriented... but settled why not a little bit of both! Since Sniper already has such a powerful tool with Jarate, I figured I'd supplement it with a new jar that has more utility for tracking, or for your teammates to use!
// There... is more work to be done, but I think it should suffice for the time being. I may shift around exact properties semi-often, so keep an eye on this! Not too closely, though, it's caustic. Wait, what do you mean you didn't bring gloves or goggles??

// but when the going gets tough, you bet your enemies will all but explode into gibs! But, so will you, if you aren't careful. Paired with your very volatile ammo situation, plan ahead and throw yourself into combat in close quarters, maybe you'll do Engineer proud and walk away with some kills under your belt!

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (5:0 New/Old)]
//
// Do you hear those ominous bells tolling? Eh, probably nothing to worry about -- look, it's another update! The second to last! I was debating whether or not to just put everything into my last-last update, later this year, but decided I wanted to accompany a TF2C major update, just one more time. Once more, for the road, a minor update!
// Another patch, another set of new toys for ya. Admittedly, I was hoping to make more for this middle-update, but I just need more time and content for the remainder of my ideas! But, you'll see the last of my big ideas, with any luck, soon enough. Hang in there, we're almost done...! Until then, I'll knuckle down for y'all, and get a-crackin' for a last update y'all deserve and can be happy with!
// And, until then, I'll... think about what I want to do after. Even now, I don't want to entirely give up, but I'm determined next time will be the last major update with y'all. Maybe, just maybe, I'll release smaller patches onto it. Small surprises to accompany my completed masterwork... ehe... one can dream. But, otherwise... ciao, for now. 'Till we meet again... friends. See you soon.

// Well, well, weld, if it isn't an old-fashioned welder (or blowtorch!) This idea's been everpresent for some time, whether very early in TF2's development or with community ideas, but I wanted to see how I could get such a strange concept to work - so I got crackin'!
// Generally speaking, most people either make it a secondary pistol-replacement that uses metal as ammo to heal buildings, which I both can't do and dislike, or they just have it be a regular melee like any other Wrench, but it ignites now! But, I'd seen very few recreations really tackle how something like this'd work.
// Eventually, I settled for this strange variant - a very fast, rapidly firing melee that continually heals buildings. Great for healing off small increments, like from chip damage or ammo drain, but baaaad at dealing with burst from Engi's normal foes. For now, it works, but we'll have to see how it turns out!

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL that briefly puts pressure on contested areas or helps clear space! Very bad at direct, mid-range combat. See: Iron Bomber, SBL, High Roller]
//
// You make enough explosives, and the gears start tickin'. Pipe Bombs, Mines, Stickybombs - what are they at the end of the day, but all the same thing but with different wrapping? Embrace that, and make some horrible abominations out of your wildest nightmares - like this brand new horrible abomination to explosivekind!
// May have guessed it, but this originally started life as an Iron Bomber rework. See, the IB has a stat that makes its pipes essentially stop moving once it hits the ground. That's an incredibly cool and unique feature, and one some people make use of - but not many, sadly. A lot of people tend to just use the IB like Stock, with different properties, and completely forget or forego the entire gimmick there.
// I wanted to really try making a GL that actually, really focuses in on those stationary pipebombs, since IB doesn't really use it in a meaningful way. The result? An odd lil' hybrid between the GL and SBL - fire on congested areas or cover your escape, and your bombs explode with a fair delay in the exact spot you laid them! Your enemies and allies alike will scratch their heads figuring out what is and isn't a pipebomb, anymore!

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL for comboing that rewards good det timing with massive damage and knockback!]
//
// This weapon, truly, was and is a monster of moving parts. I'm still thoroughly astounded Colrot did as much of this basework as they did - this is a miracle of engineering! Functions aside, though, it's just the LC!
// The Loose Cannon itself is such a peculiar weapon, but the basic workings of it survive into TF2C with this - time your grenades well and use it to combo off of itself for a big, big blast! Complete with the thunk noise!
// It DOES have some mechanical differences, most notably being unable to reload, but given how nightmarish the scripting for this weapon is, I think we can live with that for now...

// Weapon made by Colrot!

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL for practicing the ins-and-outs of Grenade Jumping! Also helpful for jump timing. See: R. Jumper & S. Jumper]
//
// An odd little inclusion, but one I was wanting for some time! There do exist mods for this sort of thing - but I decided making a weapon to help my training efforts would be good! Plus, Demoman has more usable options for Secondary now, so it's worth a go!
// The timing specifically was one aspect of grenade jumps that I always had difficulty with, so hopefully this proves helpful. I've discovered these are VERY powerful jumps and shouldn't be slept on!
// This DOES mean Demoman has 2 Jumpers now, though. Teehee. Now to invent a Bottle Jumper! Caber Jumper? Hmm...

// Whoa, what's that? A new training weapon!? Don't mind if I do! Straight from the vaults of the K.R. Fawkes Arms Dealership itself, it's the Ultimate Jumper! The last "Jumper" you'll ever need, it's powered by the most powerful explosives known to man... concrete bricks. You'll be the master of the lost art of Brick Jumping in no time!
// What's that, you want to hear about it's combat abilities? Sorry, I don't have anything to say, it's easily the weakest TF2C weapon there is. Just, absolutely pitiful. Don't even try using it against enemies, what ever will they think of you!? If not for the Brick Jumping, who would EVER want to use a weapon like this!?
// It's just so, so pitifully weak, so weak that Mr. Fawkes himself sealed it away inside 23 separate vaults, all booby-trapped with metric tons of high explosives. Please, just stop thinking of it as a weapon. It's just a training tool, and we promise that it won't eviscerate everybody in front of you - including yourself! H-hey, wait, where are you going!? Sir? Madame!? That'll be $1.49!!

// Ahh, the Skullbuster. This weapon and I go quite a ways back to before I even knew how to mod. It was one of the first mods I'd used as a kid, and I ended up making a revamped version of it... because SOME people on the workshop though it'd be cool to make a new version and NOT release it! Thanks, TF2 Workshoppers.
// That aside, I thought it would be cute - if a bit dumb looking - to have this finally make it into the Weapons Pack after all these years. I think it deserves the spot, although I'm starting to regret it since he won't shut up. Do you still have the shovel I gave you?

//-------------------------------------------------------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// This is an unfortunate section, but sadly necessary. This is for weapons that, for some reason or another, I deem unfit to work in any form.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That is RARE, considering I can generally just rework a weapon entirely if it's not making me happy! 
//--RETIRED / OBSOLETE ITEMS AREA (4400 - 4500)----------------------// This would be for stuff that -fundamentally- doesn't or can't be reworked. At all.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// It's also where weapons that are rendered obsolete - by official inclusion into TF2C - go. 
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// In both cases, I'll strip the weapon of its old stats and give it a new rarity...! Silver lining, y'know?

// [Overview: Medic - A Bonesaw that adds Übercharge on hit, but is much slower than Stock! See: Überspritze]
//
// Are you happy with the Überspritze, but just wish it could "cut" it a bit more? Maybe if it "saw" a bit of a different future, it might be a more dangerous-looking weapon? Or, do you just really, really want to inject people while still using a Bonesaw?
// Well, you're in luck! A mixup at the Bonesaw Factory and the Syringe Factory created a somehow-familiar looking weapon... a fearsome looking saw with a blade and syringe to match, we'll call it... "The Übersaw". And it could be yours, for a low, low payment of $4.99!
// (Okay, for a serious summary - I just like the old Übersaw, and wanted to have it back. It has the old stats, if you want those! But, it makes little difference, an übersaw's an überspritze's an über-weapon! Saw through their bones like it's 2008!)

// [Overview: Heavy - An AAGun that quickly fires lower-damage rockets across an area, for limited area control and splash damage! Also gives mobility! See: AA Cannon, Minigun]
//
// When TF2C team pushed TF2C's first official release, Death & Taxes, it also included were a few very, very interesting remnants of scrapped content and weapons. The AA Gun was one of them... and I've attempted to re-create it! With some creative liberties, of course~
// Originally, it was some sort of "Minigun" with a much more limited clipsize that shot explosives of... some, kind. Heavy can also blast jump with it by default! So, that's cool! I decided to fold all of these into my new iteration of it, so hopefully it's fun to mess with!
// To my surprise... they decided to finally, actually re-visit the AAGun idea, and officially released it the next update! So, not wanting to totally remove this, I gave this an honorary Vintage quality, and reworked it to be a might faster-firing variant! Complete with blast jump... it's important to the LORE.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! Custom Stats / Attributes
//-----
// [Overview: A set of new stats / attributes, mostly to add custom stat-text but also to fix or tweak some stuff! Everything here's already included in some way in default TF2C!]
//
// At long last, with NOWP v2.5.0, this mod now uses custom attributes!! For the most part, it's mostly used for new text-display, but occasionally also for stat functions! Thanks to azzy, of course, for letting attributes accept plaintext descriptions~!
// Really, as mentioned, I mostly just make use of these to change stat text - be that making new text not present in tf2c_english.txt, or simplifying wording to not be so ridiculously wordy, or even just changing colors around. It's simple work, and NOWP hardly -needs- it per-se, but it helps make it all feel just that bit more official. Really.
// If you're modding New-Old Weapons Pack, or using one of its weapons, it'd probably be best if you copy any relevant attributes from here to your project. The game might fuss, piss itself, cry, and / or die (probably in that order) otherwise, if you don't.
