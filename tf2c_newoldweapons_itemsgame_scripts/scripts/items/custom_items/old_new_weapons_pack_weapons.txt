		"3300" 																					// [Item ID] 			[!] A unique number ID for this specific weapon! Every wpn (& variants) can only use one ID number each, so make sure you don't re-use any numbers! Most of my stuff hangs out in the 3300's and above.
		{
			"name"						"TF_WEAPON_CROWBAR"		// [Internal Name] 		- A name for some backend stuff! Set this to anything, or leave it out entirely if you like. Rarely has any effect, but sometimes gets used by Response Rules, if you mess with those.
			"mod_item"					"1"											"prefab"					"weapon_bat"											// [Prefab] 			- A Prefab is a set of basic, predefined info - like what base weapon it is, or what classes use it - if you're making a variant of an existing weapon. Use these to save time - or set info manually if you wish! This mod has no custom prefabs, so look for examples in regular items_game.txt!
			"item_class"				"tf_weapon_bat"											// [Item Class] 		[!] What item_class is this using as a base, for basic weapon functions! Most base weapons in TF2 have useful properties, so experiment. For many of these keyvalues, these are already defined in a prefab, if using one.
			"item_slot"					"melee"													// [Item Slot]			[!] What loadout slot is this equipped in? Probably a good idea to set this, if the prefab doesn't! Note, somewhat weird behavior can result if you try to put an item in a different slot than it usually is, I won't cover that here!
			"anim_slot"					"melee"													// [Anim. Set]			- What animation set does it use in-game? This isn't needed most of the time, but can be helpful for unique weapons that use different animations (like a Secondary using Primary animations)
			"show_in_armory"			"1"														// [Show in Loadout] 	[!] VERY important for any weapon! Essentially, does it show up in your Loadout to select? This should always be enabled on any weapon you ever make!!

			"image_inventory_size_w"	"128"													// [BP Image Size]		[!] These are only useful if you AREN'T using a prefab, this just tells TF2 how wide and tall a BP image is! It freaks out if no info's defined, fun.
			"image_inventory_size_h"	"82"

			"propername"				"0"														// [Is a Proper-Name?]	- If enabled, adds the prefix "The " (or localized variant) to an item's name! As a quick rule, say "a Crowbar" or "the Crowbar" aloud; if it seems like there's multiple in any base and the name is just what it is, leave this disabled. If it seems singular, custom-made, or like its name is a "Product Name", then enable this!
			"item_name_color"			"204 204 250 255"										// [Name Color]			- A custom color for the item's name! You can use it as a stand-in for unique item rarities, if you like. The format is RGBA, and the last number is always 255 unless you're weird!
			"item_name"					"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Name]			[!] The display name of the item! This accepts plaintext, but #TF_Localization is nice if present! You can put fake-prefix words at the start of a name to stand-in for modifiers like new rarities, or stuff like killstreak or strange indicators!
			"item_type_name"			"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Type]			- What kind of generic object is this? Be concise! Use terms like "Rifle" or "Fire Extinguisher", and only add extra descriptive adjectives if it's absolutely nessecary!
			"item_description"			"Good for bashing a chucklehead's skull in."			// [Description] 		[!] A description box! Explain extra weapon functions, include short quotes, or just leave helpful info! Use TF2C's descriptions as a style-guide - you can mimic quotes by doing 'this' or “this”, and you can include linebreaks by making a new line in your text editor! You can see some examples below.
			"item_logname"				"crowbar"												// [Console Log Name]	- What it's called when referred to in Dev. Console's killfeed. This doesn't really do much, but it's good practice to have this be the same as the actual kill-icon name.
			"item_iconname"				"crowbar"												// [Kill-Icon]			[!] A kill-icon sprite to use, from mod_textures.txt! Adding new kill-icons is a long process, so you can leave this out, and it'll use the default kill-icon for the type of weapon you're using anyway!
			"image_inventory"			"backpack/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar"					// [Backpack Icon]		[!] A Backpack icon, used for your Loadout! Important note; TF2C automatically adds "_large.vmt" to the filename and tries loading that, so ".../w_crowbar" actually looks for ".../w_crowbar_large.vmt"! Keep this in mind...
			"model_world"				"models/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [World Model]		[!] A weapon's w_model - used for holding the weapon on your playermodel. You can often use Live TF2 c_models as w_models, but TF2C adds many new features, so be mindful!!
			"model_player"				"models/weapons/v_models/v_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [C / View Model]		[!] A weapon's v_model, or c_model! TF2C viewmodels are a weapon model and viewmodel anims on the same model, and that's it. Class arms are attached on afterward, so decompile a few v_models and mess around!
			"attach_to_hands"			"2"														// [Use w/v, or c?]		[!] How should this weapon use its models? Set this to "1" for Live TF2 c_models, or "2" for TF2C w/v_models. Most TF2C weapons SHOULD be "2", for the extra versatility allowed.
			"used_by_classes"																	// [Used by Class]		[!] Who's able to equip this? For a class that can equip this, it shows up in whatever loadout slot you input earlier. For multi-class weapons, you can set a slot, like "primary" instead of "1", to have that class get it in a different slot!
