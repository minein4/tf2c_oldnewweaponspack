//-- Custom Kill Icons --//
//-----------------------//
//
// [June 28, 2022]
// Hi! You might be wondering why this is hud_textures.txt now, instead of mod_textures.txt
// The long and short of it is - I did a bit of looking at some of the public code for SDK2013, and apparently the game loads TWO files when it comes to HUD icons - not just mod_textures!!
// (Look at it here, completely public; https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/mp/src/game/client/hud.cpp)
//
// So, why bother? Eh. It's mostly because mod_textures gets updated fairly frequently - be it new HUD elements for gamemodes, OFFICIAL weapon kill icons, icons for new buildings, etc.
// Meanwhile, hud_textures.txt is VERY rarely touched so far as I understand - it's not even present in TF2Classic's install, so I had to grab it from SDK2013-MP's folders! (which are all HL2 defaults might I add.)
// I figure - since this file gets updated FAR LESS FREQUENTLY (read: basically never), and I have to modify one of the two files anyway, I might as well modify hud_textures.
//
// If your mod uses mod_textures.txt, it's still fine! It'll load as normal alongside hud_textures.txt!
// I should note though, in the code, it looks like hud_textures gets loaded first, and then mod_textures second. I'm not sure how much of an effect that'll have on icons, but it's something to consider!
//
//---
//
// That aside, welcome! This and mod_textures.txt are central icons files for TF2 / TF2C!
// This one in particular is reserved pretty much exclusively for Custom Weapon icons - since they need to be defined here.
// SPECIFICALLY, as of a new development - we can treat this file like a game_sounds_manifest.txt - a central file in which to load EVERYTHING else!
//
// I learned about this from user and friend Yakibomb, who themselves learned it from grand arch-wizard supreme ficool2 (hallowed be his name), who honestly yeah I would have expected to be the one to reveal this
// Below, EVERY Custom Weapons mod that exists right now that I can think of has an entry - if you own or made one of these, feel free to include this file as well as your own entry into your mod!
//
// Note: As it is packaged right now, it only has actual icon-files for New-Old Weapons Pack's Icons + Additions!
// Other entries will WORK - but you need to first get the icon files from wherever else, first! Either from the other mod's main install or something.
//
// As you can see, this file is very easy to edit. If you want to add a new pack, just add one below!
// That way, if you're so inclined, you can very easily update this! And, even add kill-icons for unlisted packs!
